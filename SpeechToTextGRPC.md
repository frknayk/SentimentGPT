# Integration of Speech-To-Text with gRPC Framework

Integrating a speech-to-text (STT) API into our zero-shot classification package using gRPC is a powerful way to enhance the application in the future.

However, there may be several challenges the application might face.
I will dig into those potential challenges:

## Main Challenges

### Ensuring Load Balancing On The Servers

```Text
As the number of servers can change automatically as they grow (or shrink), 
the clients should possess the capability to leverage the new servers, 
discontinue connections to those that are no longer accessible, and uphold a balanced distribution of requests among them.

This equilibrium should be maintained through the application of a designated load balancing policy.
```

### Network Bottleneck

```Text
One thing to keep in mind is how much data travels from the server to the client. 
Otherwise, we might swap a problem with the computer speed for one with the network speed. 

Both the server and the client have limits on how much data they can send over the network at a time. 
To use less network space, you can think about using the built-in data compression in the gRPC system.
```

### Multiprocessing Issues with Python GRPC

```Text
The Python implementation of gRPC contends with the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which permits only one thread to execute at a time.
This might cause issues for the PyTorch data loader, which depends on multiprocessing to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.
```

### Delay in Data Transmission

```Text
The time it takes to send audio data to the STT API and receive the transcribed text back could introduce delays in the classification system.
```


### Network Reliability

```Text
Since gRPC operates over networks, one need to consider potential network disruptions or failures. 
If the connection between the application and the STT API is not reliable, it could lead to incomplete or delayed transcriptions.
```

### Longer Implementation Period

```Text
While gRPC offers advantages in terms of message transmission speed, it is worth noting that this specific API implementation tends to exhibit slower performance compared to a REST API implementation.
```

### Data Privacy and Security

```Text
Transmitting sensitive data over the network could raise privacy and security concerns.

Making sure the STT API and the communication channel are properly secured, and considering the implications of sharing potentially sensitive audio data is a key challenge.
```

### API Rate Limits and Costs

```Text
Most APIs have rate limits and usage quotas to prevent abuse. Depending on the rate at which the STT API process audio, the service might encounter API rate limiting issues.

Additionally, using an STT API could incur costs based on usage, so it's important to factor in the financial implications.
